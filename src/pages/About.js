            Hello, I'm Jan. I'm a designer, prototyper, and tinkerer that enjoys reading up on new technologies and creating experiences that I think are interesting. In the past year, I've been heavily investing a lot of time learning about blockchain, investing (in stocks and crypto), and how to build leverage.
            <br /> <br /> My goal with this website is to build a brand and have a centralized place to show case all my thoughts, creations, and curiosities.
            <br /> <br /> I'm currently designing People Experience at Workday. At the side I like doodling, researching the next investment, collecting NFTs, and jump roping/running.
